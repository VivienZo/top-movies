# Top Movies
This Angular app allows you to manipulate the top 100 list of the most popular movies of the moment.
The data comes from the RESTful API of [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
The app follows the rules of the [Material Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/data-tables.html) 
by using [Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/) (Google) 
and [Material Design Data Table](https://github.com/daniel-nagy/md-data-table) (Daniel Nagy).
